## The story
It begins on an aucion site where I became the owner of broken Dyson Submarine wet roller head.
It came full of water in the electronic's compartment, because a plastic tube feeding the water broke.
Fortunatelly this time hot glue on the PCB happend to be usefull and protected the circuit from water damage (mostly), so I was able to fix it

Dyson Submarine mop accessory is not working on old Dyson vacuums, it works only with the new v15s which, according to the Dyson website is exactly the same as v15 but with different software :clownface:

Not being able to update the software is a nice excuse untill there is a connected version of dyson vacuum (perhaps v16 or gen6) and a subscription based service - then vacuums will receive weekly updates at a low price of $19 per month.

I'm not sure if there is any communication between the vacuum and the submarine accessory because I own a very old (v15) dyson model and quite frankly I coudn't be bother to check after I discovered that connecting power to submarine head is enough to make it do it's job.

So, if the only requirement is to power the roller head and there is no way to make it work with actual functioning Dyson vaccum, the only logical way was to make new (non sucking) dumb dyson vacuum model
